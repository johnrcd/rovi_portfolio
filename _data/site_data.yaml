about:
  - Hi, I'm Rovi! I write code for apps, websites, and games.

  - I first started programming because I was interested in making games,
    though I ended up figuring out that I liked coding a little more than
    everything else.

  - For inquiries, questions, or anything else, the best way to contact me
    is through my <a href="mailto:johnrcd.ar@gmail.com">email</a>.
